# xdg-base-dirs

`xdg-base-dirs` is a Python module that provides functions to return paths to
the directories defined by the [XDG Base Directory Specification][spec], to save
you from duplicating the same snippet of logic in every Python utility you write
that deals with user cache, configuration, or data files. It has no external
dependencies.

`xdg-base-dirs` currently implements version 0.8 of the specification, released
on 8th May 2021.

> [!NOTE]
>
> `xdg-base-dirs` was previously named `xdg`, and was renamed due to an import
> collision with [`PyXDG`](https://pypi.org/project/pyxdg/). If you used `xdg`
> prior to the rename, update by changing the dependency name from `xdg` to
> `xdg-base-dirs` and the import from `xdg` to `xdg_base_dirs`.

## Installation

`xdg-base-dirs` requires Python 3.10 or later. To install the latest release
from [PyPI] with [pip], use:

```bash
python3 -m pip install xdg-base-dirs
```

Alternatively, since `xdg-base-dirs` is only a single file you may prefer to
just copy `src/xdg_base_dirs/__init__.py` from the source distribution into your
project.

## Usage

```python
from xdg_base_dirs import (
    xdg_cache_home,
    xdg_config_dirs,
    xdg_config_home,
    xdg_data_dirs,
    xdg_data_home,
    xdg_runtime_dir,
    xdg_state_home,
)
```

`xdg_cache_home()`, `xdg_config_home()`, `xdg_data_home()`, and
`xdg_state_home()` return [`pathlib.Path` objects][path] containing the value of
the environment variable named `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`,
`XDG_DATA_HOME`, and `XDG_STATE_HOME` respectively, or the default defined in
the specification if the environment variable is unset, empty, or contains a
relative path rather than absolute path.

`xdg_config_dirs()` and `xdg_data_dirs()` return a list of `pathlib.Path`
objects containing the value, split on colons, of the environment variable named
`XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` and `XDG_DATA_DIRS` respectively, or the default defined in
the specification if the environment variable is unset or empty. Relative paths
are ignored, as per the specification.

`xdg_runtime_dir()` returns a `pathlib.Path` object containing the value of the
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` environment variable, or `None` if the environment variable is
not set, or contains a relative path rather than an absolute path.
