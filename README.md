# xdg [![Build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/srstevenson/xdg.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://travis-ci.org/srstevenson/xdg) [![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/srstevenson/xdg.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://github.com/srstevenson/xdg/releases) [![PyPI release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/xdg.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://pypi.org/project/xdg/)

`xdg` is a tiny Python module which provides the variables defined by the [XDG
Base Directory Specification][spec], to save you from duplicating the same
snippet of logic in every Python utility you write that deals with user cache,
configuration, or data files. It has no external dependencies.

## Installation

To install the latest release from [PyPI], use [pip]:

```bash
pip install xdg
```

Alternatively, since `xdg` is only a single file you may prefer to just copy
`xdg.py` from the source distribution into your project.

## Usage

```python
from xdg import (XDG_CACHE_HOME, XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, XDG_CONFIG_HOME,
                 XDG_DATA_DIRS, XDG_DATA_HOME, XDG_RUNTIME_DIR)
```

`XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, and `XDG_DATA_HOME` are strings containing
the value of the environment variable of the same name, or the default defined
in the specification if the environment variable is unset or empty.

`XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` and `XDG_DATA_DIRS` are lists of strings containing the value
of the environment variable of the same name split on colons, or the default
defined in the specification if the environment variable is unset or empty.

`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is a string containing the value of the environment variable
of the same name, or `None` if the environment variable is unset.
